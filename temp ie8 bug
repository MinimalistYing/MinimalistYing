Inline-block
1. For inline-block for ie8 to work, <!DOCTYPE html> has to be declared, as well as <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">for correct rendering mode. Has to be first loading element in head. 
2. inline-block may cause width problem. Use max-width: 100% or inherit to fix.
3. Try use *display: inline; *zoom:1; or float: left/right(works same as zoom), because ie8 treat inline-block as block element in cerntain condition. This supports ie6+
4. inline-block may stack or overlap on each other even they are in same line, to fix it use margin-right: 1px if possible, otherwise, use #3 tip above
5. Align to bottom: Inline or inline-block elements can be aligned to the bottom of block level elements if the line-height of the parent/block element is greater than that of the inline element.*
6. Using 'vertical-align: baseline' would stack inline-block element instead of align them.

Float and img width
.float > img, If img has max-width: 100% in IE8, it will be 0 width. image won't be seen. 
If image has default width and height set up from server, then image maybe seen but could be bigger than its container size.

Backgournd-image: url(img.jpg); Don't need quote, but sometime if IE8 have two css properties in same line, then seperated the property
in a new selectors(new selectors can be same)

max-width/height in IE8 
max-xx: auto will not override any specific value for IE8. You have to give a value(px or 100%) to override modern browser's max-width/height.
Stair case
li>a {display:block; float: left;} will make stair like render, the parent div(in this case <li>) needs to be float or inline. 

Small height not recognized
IE refuse to render smaller height than set font size. add font-size: 0 or overflow:hidden;

Overflow and Relatively Positioned 
Parent div has no position but overflow:hidden, and child div has position:relative, ie doesn't trancate child elem. Fix: add Po:r to parent div.

Table and Table-cell
1. Table or Table-cell's width may not be recognized by ie8, use table-layout: fixed.
2. Use width instead of max-width for images inside ie8 because ie8 take default image size. Or use table-layout: fixed;
3. Element inside table-cell maybe not able to absolute positioned in IE8.
4. Line-height maybe not correct in table or table cell for all IE version.
5. Table is not 100% even width: 100% is set. Add margin: 0 to table it will be 100% for ie8;
6. Thumb of rule: always add 100% along with display: table; 


CSS bugs from W3C
1. Transform and Fixed position: If parent has 'transform', then any child has position: fixed 
   will not stay as fixed element but 'absolute' element. 

Fixed top header and anchor scroll:
padding-top: 100px; margin-bottom: -100px; will create an empty gap. (search for "fixed top header and anchor scroll")
#Hash tag anchor link position is not correct when there is fixed positioned header. Solution:

Psuedo font size class bug for IE9-11
:before or :after class isn't being overriden by property defined at bottom. https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/813398/ie-11-css-before-with-font-size-in-em-units-ignores-css-precedence-rules
Using 'rem' for unit may work, but if the element's display property is 'table', it won't work. The element has to be a block level.

Psuedo text-decoration bug for IE 9-11
Same situation as above example but for text-decoration: underline property. It has to be set and reset the same property in order for :psuedo:hover or :hover:psuedo to work.

IE 10 11 Edge bug
IE doesn't recongnize position: initial; Must use 'static' instead
